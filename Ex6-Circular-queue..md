# Ex 2A Dequeue Elements from Circular Queue
## DATE: 5-3-2025
## AIM:
To write a C program to delete three elements from the filled circular queue.

## Algorithm
1. Start 
2. Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters. 
3. Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1. 
4. Print each element of the array during the loop. 
5. After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting. 
6. End

## Program:
```

*/ 
void printArray(int array[], int size) 
{ 
int i; 
for(i=0;i<size;i++) 
{ 
printf("%d ",array[i]); 
} 
printf("\n"); 
}
